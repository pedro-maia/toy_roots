# toy_roots
Toy project for practicing Git/GitHub + Colab workflow. Iterative versions: (v1) plot a line  𝑦 = 𝑎 𝑥 + 𝑏 y=ax+b and compute its root; (v2) extend to quadratic  𝑎 𝑥 2 + 𝑏 𝑥 + 𝑐 ax 2 +bx+c with an intentionally wrong root formula; (v3) detect and fix the math bug; (v4) run a small sweep over  ( 𝑎 , 𝑏 , 𝑐 ) (a,b,c) and save plots/results.
